# Asaí Software

This application was made from scratch with PHP, with no framework, but using some libraries such as fpdf and datatables. Almost all functionalities are based on Ajax.

It was developed for the management of a food store based on Açaí, a Brazilian fruit not very common in Europe. This application offers the tools to manage all areas of a physical store, from customer databases, products, interface to carry out the sale of products and a report of profits and expenses in relation to all the areas influencing the shop.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PHP**, **HTML5** and **CSS3**: Raw php 7.4 (updated to 8.3) for the main structure, dinamically generating the HTML templates and using CSS for responsive and clean styles.

- **datatables**: DataTables is a Javascript HTML table enhancing library. It helps with database data sorting and presentation.

- **fpdf**: PHP class that allows the generation of pdf documents directly from PHP, avoiding PDFlib library. Free to use.

- **mysql**: SQL database for data management and storage. Easily accesed via PHPMyAdmin.  

- **ajax**: It's mostly ajax based, generating dynamic tables from user inputs.  

## 🚀 Usage

Feel free to check the code, despite you will need a copy of the database. It is connected by using the **dbconn.php** file, inside the **config** folder.

Just upload the contents to your chosen domain and start playing with the code. Email me if you need a copy of the database.
## 📝 Notes

Nowadays, this software is mainly meant for learning purposes, more than commercial use. Still, it can be useful as a basis for more complex projects, even for modules for any framework based development. 

Oh, it's in spanish. I hope you don't have trouble with it :)
